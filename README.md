JStudent
========

**A problem-based JavaScript learning resource based on 4clojure.**

Still under development. For now, check out <http://rawgithub.com/j201/jstudent/master/index.html>

JStudent is an interactive JavaScript crash course inspired by [4Clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/). Unlike similar resources like Codecademy, JStudent is intended for people who are already familiar with other programming languages and want to get an idea of how to program in JS. See the [About page](http://rawgithub.com/j201/jstudent/master/about.html) for more details.
